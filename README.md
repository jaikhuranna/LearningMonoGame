# LearningMonoGame Readme

## Overview
Welcome to the LearningMonoGame repository! In this project, I am documenting my journey of learning MonoGame through a video tutorial and the official documentation. The primary resource I am following is the video tutorial available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPH-sNTSrhw&t=546s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPH-sNTSrhw&t=546s). The goal is to gain a solid understanding of MonoGame and its principles by working on practical examples and projects.

## Project Structure
The project structure follows a simple organization for clarity and ease of navigation. Here's an overview of the key directories and files:

## Project Progress
As of the latest update, I have completed a simple project as part of the learning process. The project provided valuable insights into the workings of MonoGame. One notable difference from other game development platforms, such as Unity, is the absence of a graphical user interface (GUI). This distinction is particularly interesting for Linux enthusiasts like me, as MonoGame allows for a more hands-on and code-centric approach to game development.
